## Storyboard (Round 2)



Experiment 1: Generation of Basic Signals

### 1. Story Outline:

Digital signal processing is integral part of modern life. It is an important aspect to effective
communications across mobiles, laptops, satellite, video, radio and all communication systems;
signal processing makes the processing and transmission of data more efficient.
The
experiment given in this virtual lab is about understanding basic signals and analyzing those
signals using basic operations.

### 2. Story:

In this experiment, students will be able to become familiar with basic signals. Signals are the
waveforms which carry information. As information has no limit in variety, signals also have no
limits in its types. However, to start learners should start from basic signals. Some of the basic
signals of our interest are (1) step signal (2) Impulse signal (3) Exponential signal (4) ramp signal
and (5) sine signal.

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
When a user comes into the simulator, in the first page he will learn about the lab, importance
of the lab and objectives of the lab. He can learn the theory related to the experiment and
algorithm to perform experiments. Users are supposed to attempt pre-lab quiz before
performing experiments in the simulator. Now user can navigate to simulator where he/she can
perform experiment using a in page simulator and buttons. If user face problem, then he/she
can use help/hint button to get hint for simulation.

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
The aims of this experiment are to make user familiar with the basic signals. This is established
with the help of observation of basic signals, understanding of basic signals and mathematical
analysis over basic signals.

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

As soon as a user comes to the virtual lab of the signals and systems, he will first understand
about the lab and about the experiment. After knowing about the experiment he will understand
objectives of the experiment. User will give pre lab test, perform the experiment. After
completion of the experiment, user will be exposed

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Describe the challenges Here : (guide : Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/variations in questions according to User’s level, so as to invoke the learners’ interest.  (while traversing, what challenges he will face? how he has to solve and overcome ? descriptive).)

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
Describe the pitfalls here: (guide : (while traversing or while solving challenge, how will we bring a situation in front of him that he commits mistake if he is not attentive , or not following procedure , descriptive))

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
Describe conclusion here : (guide: This may include displaying: how much time did the user take to solve the questions/ How many questions were right?/ How many hints did the learner use. Based on this the evaluation/marking to be suggested to the user. (once he is towards the completion of the experiment, what LO he is taking along with him, what will be his probable, interpretation/conclusion , descriptive) )

##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
Type equations here : (guide : ( a separate sheet having equations / programs for the lab exper3ment to be shared along with the Story submissions (1) . You can mark it as numerical reference numbers within the story narration (like we cite in the research papers) and then separately share these equations/programs sheets as a reference, do not include the equations as a whole in the narration))
Tool can be used to integrate formula in Markdown <b> [here](http://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/samples/example3.php) </b>


### 3. Flowchart 4
<img src="flowchart/flowchart.png"/><br>
link to flow chart Here : Store in the  /flowchart folder within Round2 folder in your repo
<br>
(guide :The lab proposer should extract logic from the story, prepare a flowchart from the story narration and write the algorithm to execute the black box.  use Google Drawings https://docs.google.com/drawings/ (send the link to your flowchart and also attach .png by exporting it )

### 4. Mindmap:
<img src="mindmap/mindmap.png"/>
 Link to mindmap here : Store the mindmap in both .mm & .png extension in the  /mindmap folder and include link of only .pdf verison here
 <br>
 (guide : An elaborate mind map (connecting all the points in the experiment flow ) should be prepared and submitted by the lab proposer. The mind map should be a clear and detailed document that takes into account all minute intri5acies involved in the development of virtual lab. The mindmap should be self-content and any developer across the globe should be able to code it with all those details. using only FreeMind http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page (send the .png file and also the original .mm extension project file. )

### 5. Storyboard :
Storyboard: <a href="Storyboard/carwiper.gif"> [here]</a>
Link to storybaord (.gif file ) here :
(guide: This document should include sketching and description scene wise (duration, action, description). Software to be used for storyboarding : https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/ (Its a FOSS tool) . tutorial on how to use it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAeCEpG0KX4
